\chapter{Introduction}
The present work re-enacts the classical theory of \emph{$t$\hyp{}structures} reducing the classical definition given in \cite{BBDPervers,KS1} to a rather primitive categorical gadget: suitable \emph{reflective factorization systems} (\adef \refbf{tortorfree}, \refbf{normal}), which we call \emph{normal torsion theory}, following \cite{CHK,RT}. A  relation between these two objects has previously been noticed by other authors \cite{RT,HPS,Beligiannisreiten} on the level of homotopy categories. The main achievement of the present thesis is to observe and prove that this relation exists genuinely when the definition is lifted to the higher-dimensional world where the notion of triangulated category comes from, \ie \emph{stable $(\infty,1)$\hyp{}categories}.

To achieve this result, it seemed unavoidable to adopt a preferential model for $(\infty,1)$\hyp{}category theory: instead of working in a ``model\hyp{}free'' setting, we choose the (ubiquitous) dialect of Lurie's \emph{stable $\infty$\hyp{}categories}; discussing to which extent (if any) the results we prove are affected by this choice, and establishing a meaningful dictionary between the validity of the general statement \refbf{thm:rosetta} in various different flavours on $\infty$\hyp{}category theory occupies sections \refbf{model-stable} and \refbf{model-dep}.
\section{Structure of the thesis}
The thesis is the results of a re\hyp{}organization and methodical arrangement of the papers \cite{FL0,heart,recol,infty-stab} appeared on the arXiv since August 2014; the content is basically the same, in spirit and structure; some sections and subsections (like \eg \refbf{sec:2ndglance}, \refbf{transfinite.case}, \refbf{sec:examples}, a renewed proof of \refbf{to-be-repeated-verbatim}, and \achap \refbf{chap:operat}) do not appear anywhere at the moment of writing\footnote{\today}, but contain little new material and serve as linking sections making the discussion more complete and streamlined, and to expand certain natural derivations of the basic theory which would have easily exceeded the average length of a research\hyp{}paper. 

Figure \refbf{dependen} depicts the dependencies among the various chapters: a dashed line indicates a conceptual but feeble logical dependence, whereas a thick line indicates a stronger one, unavoidable at first reading.

The first three chapters expose the main result of the present work: 
\begin{quote}
For each stable $\infty$\hyp{}category $\CC$ there is a bijective correspondence between $t$\hyp{}structures on the triangulated homotopy category $\ho(\CC)$ and suitable orthogonal factorization systems on $\CC$ called \emph{normal torsion theories}.
\end{quote}
This constitutes the backbone and the basic environment in which every subsequent application (the theory of \emph{recollements} in stable $\infty$\hyp{}categories in \achap \refbf{chap:recol}, and Bridgeland's theory of \emph{stability conditions} in \achap \refbf{chap:stabilities}) takes place.

The main original contribution given in the present work is the ``Rosetta stone'' theorem proving the quoted remark above; this is the main result of \cite{FL0}, the only preprint that, at the moment of writing, has also been published by a peer\hyp{}reviewed journal.

There are several minor results following from the ``Rosetta stone'', like the fact that constructions one can perform on normal torsion theories are (at least to the categorically\hyp{}minded) more natural and canonical than the corresponding construction in homological algebra, done on bare $t$\hyp{}structures.
\subsection{A word on model dependency}\label{sec:model-dep}
Ideally speaking, if there is an equivalence between two models for $\infty$\hyp{}categories (say, \emph{red} and \emph{blue} $\infty$\hyp{}categories), these two models both possess a notion of factorization systems and a calculus\footnote{By a ``calculus'' of factorization systems we na\"ively mean an analogue of the major results expressed in \achap \refbf{chap:effe-esse}, translated from the red to the blue model.} thereof; moreover, these two notions of factorization system correspond each other under the equivalence of models. At the moment of writing it is not clear whether this principle of equivalence and correspondence can be expressed as a genuine theorem (this is perhaps only due to the fact that the author ignores how to retrieve a similar result in the existing literature): it is however possible to recognize at least three different such settings.
\begin{itemize}
\item stable model categories, where one can speak about \emph{homotopy factorization systems} following \cite{Bousfield,Joy}; this leads to define \emph{homotopy $t$-structure} on stable model categories as suitable analogues of normal torsion theories in the set $\smallcap{hfs}(\cate{M})$ of homotopy factorization systems on a model category $\cate{M}$.
\item \dg-categories, where we speak about enriched (over $\textsf{Ch}(\mathbf{k})$) factorization systems (see \cite{enrichFSDay}); this leads to define \emph{\smallcap{dg}\hyp{}$t$\hyp{}structures} as enriched analogues of normal torsion theories in the set of $\smallcap{dg-fs}(\D)$ of enriched factorization systems on a \dg\hyp{}category $\D$.
\item derivators, where we can define \emph{$t$-derivators} via a (genuinely new) notion of factorization system on a derivator, and recognize the analogue of normal torsion theory in this setting. 
\end{itemize}
At the moment of writing, all these points are being studied, and will hopefully appear as separate results in the near future.
\subsection{A word on the state of the art}
Drawing equally from homological algebra, algebraic geometry\fshyp{}topology and category theory, the present work has not a single, well\hyp{}defined flavour. Several sources of inspirations came from classical literature in algebraic topology \cite{HPS,tierney1969categorical,shc}; several others belong to the classical and less classical literature on algebraic geometry \cite{VerdierDesDes,Brid,Bridge2,Bondal1995}; others belong to pure category theory \cite{RT, CHK,JanelidzeMarkl,Korostenski199357,Lucyshyn-Wright,zangurashvili2004several}, and others (see below) do not even belong to what is canonically recognized as mathematical literature.

The approach to the theory of $\infty$\hyp{}categories taken here will certainly appear rather unorthodox to some readers: \cite{HTT} has taught to the author more about 1\hyp{}categories than he did about $\infty$\hyp{}categories. This, again, must be attributed to the ignorance of the author, which is more comfortable with the language of categories rather than with homotopy theory.
\subsection*{Notation and Conventions.}
Categories (in the broad sense of ``categories and $\infty$\hyp{}categories'') are denoted as boldface letters $\CC,\D$ and suchlike, opposed to generic, variable simplicial sets which are denoted by capital Latin letters (this creates an extremely rare, harmless conflict with the same notation adopted for objects in a category: the context always allows to avoid confusion); functors between categories are always denoted as capital Latin letters in a sufficiently large neighbourhood\footnote{The set $A$ of letters of the English alphabet admits an obvious monotone bijection $A\xto{\varphi}\Delta[26]$; define a distance on $A$ by putting $d(-,=) \defequal |\varphi(-) - \varphi(=)|$.} of $F,G,H,K$ and suchlike; the category of functors $\CC\to \D$ is denoted as $\text{Fun}(\CC,\D)$, $\D^{\CC}$, $[\CC,\D]$ (or, at the risk to be pedantic, as $\QCat(\CC, \D)$); morphisms in $\text{Fun}(\CC,\D)$ (i.e. natural transformations between functors) are often written in Greek alphabet; the simplex category $\bDelta$ is the \emph{topologist's delta}, having objects \emph{nonempty} finite ordinals $\Delta[n]:=\{0<1\dots<n\}$ regarded as categories in the obvious way; we adopt \cite{HTT} as a main reference for $\infty$\hyp{}category theory, even if we can't help but confess that we profited of every single opportunity to deviate from the aesthetic of that book; in particular, we accept the (alas!) settled abuse to treat ``quasicategory'' and ``$\infty$\hyp{}category'' as synonyms; any other unexplained choice of notation belongs to folklore, or leans on common sense.

When we want to refer to a particularly difficult, tricky, misleading or simply a key passage, we follow Bourbaki's famous notation \cite{Bourbaki} for a ``tournant dangereux'', denoted as a \verb|\textdbend| \marginpar{\textdbend} symbol like the one besides, usually put on a margin note.

A general working principle of stable $\infty$\hyp{}category theory is that homological algebra becomes easier and better motivated when looked from a higher perspective\footnote{This rather operative and meta-linguistic principle is sketched in our Appendix \refbf{chap:stable-cats}, where a complete proof of how triangulated category axioms follow from the ``pullout axiom'' \refbf{pullout.axiom} is worked out in full detail.}. To refer to this more natural environment we will often call \emph{the stable setting} any (see \refbf{sec:model-dep}) theory of stable $\infty$\hyp{}categories.

\marginpar{\textdbend} A non completely standard choice of notation is the following: each time a concept {\sf notion} appears together with its dual, we write {\sf co}\fshyp{}{\sf notion} to denote that we refer to {\sf notion} and {\sf conotion} at the same time. So, if we write ``$\CC$ is a co\fshyp{}complete category'' we mean that $\CC$ is \emph{both} complete and cocomplete, and if we write ``co\fshyp{}limit'' we are speaking about limits \emph{and} colimits at the same time.
